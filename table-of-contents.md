  - Use case: handwriting recognition? (MNIST/EMNIST?)
  - Use case: healthcare TDA dataset(s) (can split into multiple chapters, depending on how many use cases there are and how similar they are to each other)

----------
Thoughts:
* For chapters with methods not covered (or not covered well) by an existing R package (e.g. Mapper?), can/should we create appropriate R packages?
* Would be nice to structure book in a way that would make it usable for applied TDA university courses (e.g. exercises at end of each chapter)
